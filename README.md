SMS Classifier: Spam or Non-Spam

Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham). The classifier is trained on a dataset containing labeled examples of spam and non-spam messages, and it leverages natural language processing techniques to make predictions on new, unseen messages.
